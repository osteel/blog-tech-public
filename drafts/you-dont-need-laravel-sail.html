<p>Truman continues to steer his wrecked sailboat towards the infinitely receding horizon. All is calm until we see the bow of the boat suddenly strike a huge, blue wall, knocking Truman off his feet. Truman recovers and clambers across the deck to the bow of the boat. Looming above him out of the sea is a cyclorama of colossal dimensions. The sky he has been sailing towards is nothing but a painted backdrop.</p>

<p>On December 8 2020, Taylor Otwell announced the launch of <a href="https://laravel.com/docs/sail">Laravel Sail</a>, a development environment based on Docker, along with a substantial overhaul of the documentation:</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">üì∏ If you missed my stream walking through Laravel Sail and chatting about some of the documentation improvements, you can watch it here! Stream really starts at the timestamp in this link: <a href="https://t.co/U0otoNHg8U">https://t.co/U0otoNHg8U</a> üì∏</p>&mdash; Taylor Otwell ‚õµÔ∏è (@taylorotwell) <a href="https://twitter.com/taylorotwell/status/1336357588791947264?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">December 8, 2020</a></blockquote>

<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>
<p>The announcement caused a wave of excitement across the community, as a lot of people welcomed Laravel Sail as a way to finally get into Docker. It also left some confusion in its wake, which compelled me to writing this piece about what to expect from it and, maybe more importantly, what not to expect.</p>
<p>But to get there, we first need to take a look under the deck, starting with a high level definition of what Sail is.</p>
<h2 id="what-is-laravel-sail">What is Laravel Sail?</h2>
<p>Sail is Laravel's latest official development environment, completing an already rich collection comprising <a href="https://laravel.com/docs/homestead">Homestead</a> and <a href="https://laravel.com/docs/valet">Valet</a> on the official side, as well as non-official solutions such as <a href="https://laragon.org">Laragon</a>, <a href="http://laradock.io">Laradock</a>, <a href="https://github.com/tighten/takeout">Takeout</a> or <a href="https://vessel.shippingdocker.com/">Vessel</a> (according to Otwell, Sail is largely inspired by the latter).</p>
<p>Sail is based on <a href="https://www.docker.com">Docker</a>, a technology leveraging <a href="https://www.docker.com/resources/what-container">containers</a> to essentially package up applications so they run quickly and easily anywhere.</p>
<p>The Laravel team seems to have big plans for Sail, as the documentation overhaul it came with places it at the center of the Laravel experience, suggesting it is aimed at replacing solutions like Homestead and Valet, which occupied that spot until now.</p>
<h2 id="how-is-it-different">How is it different?</h2>
<p>So what is Sail's value proposition compared to its predecessors?</p>
<p>As a refresher, Homestead is a <a href="https://www.vagrantup.com">Vagrant</a> box loaded up with everything most Laravel applications will need, including PHP, MySQL and a web server (Nginx) for the essentials, but also other technologies like PostgreSQL, Redis, Memcached, or Node. Valet, on the other hand, is a lightweight environment for macOS focusing on performance, installing and configuring PHP on the local machine directly instead of relying on a virtual machine, and plugging with other services like <a href="https://dbngin.com">DBngin</a> or Takeout to manage databases, for instance.</p>
<p>On paper these solutions look quite different; but these environments as well as the aforementioned non-official solutions all have something in common: they aim at managing all of your Laravel projects. In other words, the same environment serves all your local applications, and tries to anticipate and cater for most Laravel applications' needs.</p>
<p>It's true that one could use a different Homestead box per project, but in practice, most people don't, as doing so is quite cumbersome.</p>
<p>Laravel Sail is different, in that the environment setup is versioned with the rest of the codebase. This is not an option, but the default behaviour. This is, in my opinion, the most exciting thing about Laravel Sail: with this approach, your application comes with its own development environment, which is just a few commands away, provided you've got Docker installed on your machine.</p>
<p>You can now build development environments tailored to each project's needs, embedded in the codebase. Anyone with Docker installed on their machine can now just pull your code, and run <code>sail up</code> to have the full environment running in seconds, no matter what their operating system is.</p>
<p>That is the true power of Docker for development, in my opinion.</p>
<p>Sail comes with a few interesting things out of the box and make it easy to build upon them, in a way which is much easier than what the other options make possible.</p>
<p>Let's take a look at these features, and at the way they're implemented through Sail.</p>
<h2 id="how-does-it-work">How does it work?</h2>
<p>Take every existing feature and explain how it's implemented.</p>
<p>As mentioned earlier, the new documentation now makes Sail the preferred way to get started with Laravel; with a single command (which will be different <a href="https://laravel.com/docs/installation#your-first-laravel-project">based on your operating system</a>), the necessary Docker images will be pulled, and the Composer dependencies installed automatically.</p>
<p><img alt="Installation" src="/images/sail_02.png" title="Installation" /></p>
<p>Nice.</p>
<p>You're then invited to run the following command from the project's root:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>$ ./vendor/bin/sail up
</pre></div>


<p>This one will pull the Docker image for MySQL if it's not present on your system yet, and build the image whose container will run the actual Laravel application.</p>
<p>MySQL, Redis, MailHog, Composer, Artisan commands, sail share.</p>
<p>Definitely seems quite slow, as the welcome page takes a while to display.</p>
<p>This is fine to get started, but far from enough for even a rather basic application. We'll get into how we can build upon these foundations; but first, let's see how we run multiple applications with Laravel Sail, and make sure they don't conflict.</p>
<p><code>docker-compose.yml</code>. It reads the <code>.env</code> file.</p>
<p>https://github.com/laravel/sail/blob/1.x/stubs/docker-compose.yml</p>
<p>Bash layer</p>
<p>https://github.com/laravel/sail/blob/1.x/bin/sail</p>
<h2 id="extending-laravel-sail">Extending Laravel Sail</h2>
<p>Possible to some extent, with limitations.</p>
<p>While using Sail in conjunction with something like Takeout is possible and would make up for some of Sail's limitations, we would partially be back to relying on a centralised environment (Takeout), which we would expect the whole team to have running on their machine.</p>
<p>Sail opens the way to having the whole development environment included with the codebase; my opinion is that we should embrace it fully and not rely on having anything else installed but Docker.</p>
<h3 id="running-multiple-applications">Running multiple applications</h3>
<p>Port conflict. Maybe even container name conflict ‚Äì introduce <code>COMPOSE_PROJECT_NAME</code> in </p>
<p>Changer <code>APP_PORT</code> and <code>DB_PORT</code> in <code>.env</code> file.</p>
<h3 id="install-extra-extensions">Install extra extensions</h3>
<p>Is it even possible or is that a limitation?</p>
<h3 id="adding-new-services">Adding new services</h3>
<p>Use Postgres as an example, add environment variables following the <code>APP_PORT</code> and <code>DB_PORT</code> convention introduced by Sail.</p>
<p>Postgres is just an example; you can do that with pretty much any technology you wish to try. Most major actors have Docker images (official ones or maintained by the community) with easy to follow instructions on how to use them. Go and have a look at Docker Hub, type anything you're interested in trying out and read the description. In most case, you will have an instance running locally in minutes.</p>
<h3 id="running-the-scheduler">Running the scheduler</h3>
<p>Ofelia?</p>
<h3 id="a-worker-to-process-queues">A worker to process queues</h3>
<p>Instead of relying on the <code>sync</code> driver, much closer to production. This one is not an absolute requirement as most people use the <code>sync</code> driver locally anyway, but I want to show you how deep you can go with the extension game, and introducing a worker is a good way to do that.</p>

<h2 id="so-whats-wrong-with-laravel-sail">So what's wrong with Laravel Sail?</h2>
<p>If you got this far, you're probably wondering what still could be wrong about Laravel Sail, now that we've seen all of these strategies to extend it. Let me break it to you right now: now that you know and understand all of these strategies, you simply don't need Laravel Sail anymore.</p>
<p>But before I elaborate on this, let's review the current limitations of the environment, even though I fully expect the Laravel team to address most of them sooner or later.</p>
<p>That's right ‚Äì if you understood all of the above, there's hardly any reason to artificially constrain yourself within the confines of Laravel.</p>
<p>That's right, you could basically write your own version version of it, without artificially restraining yourself to the borders of Laravel.</p>
<p>Based on <code>php artisan serve</code>, no easy way to add a proper HTTP server. An HTTP server opens the door to domain names, HTTPS, and exposing local containers to the Internet (that one's not true anymore). The Bash layer can't easily be extended (although maybe can write your own Bash file and import the <code>sail</code> file).</p>
<p>Extensions?</p>
<p>These limitations are currently hard to circumvent, and combined with the knowledge we've acquired so far, lead to the main point.</p>
<h2 id="youre-one-step-away-from-total-freedom">You're one step away from total freedom</h2>
<p>If you want to do anything useful beyond displaying the welcome page, you will need to extend Sail. That means you will have to understand how to customise the <code>docker-compose.yml</code> file, and probably how to write your own Dockerfiles. You won't be able to easily add new Bash commands and will probably run Docker commands directly instead.</p>
<p>With all this being said and done, what would prevent you from writing your own <code>docker-compose.yml</code> file, or your own Bash shortcuts?</p>
<p>Nothing.</p>
<p>Once you get there, there's absolutely nothing preventing you from doing your own stuff, without the constraints brought about by Laravel Sail.</p>
<p>So why not just do it?</p>
<p>The implications go even further. Why just use Docker for Laravel? Sail is contained in the Laravel application, but what if your application is not a monolith, and Laravel is just a part of it? Maybe you've got a separate frontend, and Laravel is used as its API? If that's the case, you might want a development environment that will manage them both, running them together just like on a staging environment or in production. If you like your monorepos, your Docker configuration could be at the root of the project, and you could have your frontend and backend applications is separate subfolders under an <code>src</code> folder. That would essentially look like this:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>my-app/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ src/
‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ backend/
‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ frontend/
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ docker-compose.yml
</pre></div>


<p>Do your backend and frontend applications live in different repositories? Create a third one, containing your Docker development environment. Just complete your Bash script to also pull both application repositories ‚Äì it's easy.</p>
<p>Even if your project is strictly based on Laravel, this kind of structure is already a cleaner separation than having the development files mixed-up with the application's source code. Plus, if your application grows bigger and needs other components besides Laravel, you're already in a good position to support them.</p>
<p>You can even reuse Sail's Dockerfiles (there's currently a <a href="https://github.com/laravel/sail/blob/1.x/runtimes/7.4/Dockerfile">PHP 7.4 version</a> and a <a href="https://github.com/laravel/sail/blob/1.x/runtimes/8.0/Dockerfile">PHP 8 one</a>).</p>
<p>The point is, once you break that mental barrier, everything is possible. You don't need to live in the constraints of one particular framework anymore, and you regain full control of your development environment.</p>
<p>There is one aspect of using Docker for local development, however, which applies to both approach and should be carefully considered before taking the plunge.</p>
<h2 id="the-elephant-in-the-room">The elephant in the room</h2>
<p>It would be intellectually dishonest of me not to mention it at this stage</p>
<p>There is one major limitation which does not seem to be mentioned anywhere so far, however, which relates to performance. While it should be perfectly fine on Linux and acceptable on Windows as long as WSL 2 is used, on macOS you will most likely experience a rather slow environment. I won't go into too much detail here, but it's essentially because of the filesystem, which does not perform well for mounted local directories.</p>
<p>This is Sail's current approach as we've seen earlier, and based on the time it takes Laravel's welcome page to display on my Mac, this issue hasn't been addressed.</p>
<p>That doesn't change the point, however: if you are comfortable with performance as it is, there is still no reason to use Laravel Sail over your own custom implementation.</p>
<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>Don't get me wrong: Laravel Sail is a great step in the right direction when it comes to web development, and I am glad to see such an established actor push forward the adoption of Docker for local environments.</p>
<p>We love our frameworks because they provide guidelines to achieve desirable results in a way we know to be efficient and battle-tested, and it's only natural that they also provide the environment that will allow us to follow and apply those guidelines. But what Laravel Sail unintendedly shows us is that the latter doesn't have to be part of the mandate anymore.</p>
<p>Much like Truman's small sailboat helps him overcome his fear of the sea and eventually gets him to the exit of his gilded cage, Laravel Sail can show us both the natural limits of the framework and a way to break free of them.</p>
<p>But Sail is only the beginning of the journey. It is quite limited and somewhat limiting in its current form, and is unlikely to make people Docker experts all of a sudden. Docker's major strengths when it comes to development is its portability, the flexibility it offers, and the way it empowers developers to easily install and run new services.</p>
<p>Moreover, Docker naturally makes you think at the system level (your application as a part of a whole) instead of boxing you to the confines of the application. The bigger picture now appears to you, and you become a better developer for it.</p>
<p>If this sounds exciting but you're still unsure how to get started, I invite you to take a look at the <a href="https://tech.osteel.me/posts/docker-for-local-web-development-part-1-a-basic-lemp-stack">series I published on the subject</a>. It covers web servers, HTTPS, domain names, and many other things, using Laravel and VueJS as example applications. No prior knowledge of Docker is required. It doesn't have all of the answers, but will get you to a place where you can find your own.</p>
<p>You might currently be in a position where Laravel Sail is more than enough for your needs. Or you may think you're not yet ready to venture in the outside world on your own, and you'd rather stay in the safety of an environment carefully designed for you. Or you just can't be bothered. That's all fine. To be honest, I fully expect Laravel Sail to evolve in a way that will cater for more and more use cases, and you as a developer may even grow with it.</p>
<p>But it will always be limited by its monolithic nature, by this vision of Laravel as a one-stop shop solution. This might work for a while, but no application exists in a vacuum, and some day your Laravel application will be just one component of a system, and not the system itself. Eventually, your small sailboat will bump into the painted backdrop of this walled garden, and you will be faced with a choice.</p>
<p>What you do next is entirely up to you; just know that there's a whole world out there, waiting for you. You could choose to embrace it right now.</p>
<p>Laravel Sail is very much like the small sailboat Truman uses to escape his gilded cage. That's what it takes for him to eventually bump into the painted backdrop of his walled garden, without which he wouldn't have had access to that door. Once you get there, what you do next is entirely up to you; just know that there's a whole world out there, waiting for you. You could choose to embrace it right now.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Truman hesitates. Perhaps he cannot go through with it after all. The camera slowly zooms into Truman's face.</p>
<p><em>TRUMAN:</em> "In case I don't see you ‚Äì good afternoon, good evening and good night."</p>
<p>He steps through the door and is gone.</p>
